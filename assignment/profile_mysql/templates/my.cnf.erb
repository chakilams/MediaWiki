## Performance Specific ##
##########################

innodb_buffer_pool_size 	= 12G		###	How much innodb data to store in memory. Higher = faster performance
innodb_file_per_table		= 1		###	Each innodb table is its own file on disk. 
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit 	= 2		### Flushes to disk in batches instead of per change
innodb_io_capacity		= 800		###	Min IO speed expected to write to disk. 
read_buffer_size 		= 2M		###	Helps with reading temp tables faster, bulk inserts and nested queries
read_rnd_buffer_size 		= 8M		###	Helps with multi range queries and ORDER Bys. Naemon graphs point that we need this a bit higher.
sort_buffer_size 		= 8M		### 	Helps with ORDER BY queries, which we have a lot of.
table_open_cache 		= 4096		###	Cache data about open tables. Saves reopening tables.
thread_cache_size 		= 256		### 	How many threads to cache. Can help reduce thread count.
thread_stack 			= 256k		###	How much cache each thread can have. Higher = more complicated results are cached
tmp_table_size 			= 64M		###	Max size a tmp table can be.
innodb_log_file_size 		= 512M		##	
innodb_log_files_in_group 	= 3		##
innodb_read_io_threads 		= 8		##	innodb background threads for reads. Helps with reads
join_buffer_size 		= 2M		##	Helps when a join doesn\u2019t have an index or an index wont be more helpful than a full table scan
max_heap_table_size 		= 64M		##	Max size a tmp table can be in memory
query_cache_limit 		= 2M		##
query_cache_min_res_unit 	= 2048		##
query_cache_size 		= 196M		##
query_cache_type 		= 1		##	Caches complete query results. Data gets invalidated when underlying tables are changed.
table_open_cache_instances 	= 8		##	Divides the table cache to reduce contention
table-definition-cache 		= 4096		##	Stores table definitions - .frm files
key_buffer_size 		= 16M		#	As there are no MyISAM tables, this variable helps with MyISAM temp tables.
back_log			= 1500 		#	When MySQL gets a lot of connections in a short time, it will keep them in a back log
innodb_purge_threads		= 2		#	May reduce locks for when updates/deletes are run often (like sessions table)
innodb_sort_buffer_size		= 2M		#	Helps with index changes and create table statements
#innodb_page_cleaners 		= 4		#	Will help with start up and shutdown in 5.7
binlog_cache_size		= 128K		#	May speed up transactions
binlog_stmt_cache_size		= 1M		#	May speed up transactions
